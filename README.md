# Better Behavior Syntax: An (improved!) Atom port of Behave.
Better Behavior is an Atom syntax theme originally based on [fnky's Behave syntax](https://github.com/fnky/behave-theme) for TextMate. This version adds additional highlighting to a number of familiar languages, yielding a more colorful and friendly developer experience. _But don't take my word for it..._

Work is ongoing to add additional customizations for additional languages; if you should happen to beat me to one, pull 'er, patch 'er, and PR 'er.
